    "Have you come across those problems about measuring out some amount of water using limited equipment?  Here’s an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have two buckets.  One, when full, contains $3$ litres, the other $5$ litres.  I have a large quantity of water in the water butt in my garden, and I wish to end up with exactly $17$ litres of this water in my pond.  Is this possible, just using these two buckets to transfer water?  (No part-filled buckets allowed!)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn’t take very long to see that it’s possible.  I fill the $3$-litre bucket four times, and the $5$-litre bucket once: $17 = 4\\times 3 + 5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if I only wanted $1$ litre in my pond?\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s slightly trickier, but not too hard.  I use the $3$-litre bucket twice, then take out $5$ litres.  In an equation, $1 = 2 \\times 3 - 5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What would happen if I started with a $3$-litre bucket and a $6$-litre bucket and still wanted to get $1$ litre in my pond?\n",
    "\n",
    "After a bit of experimentation, we might notice that the quantities we can make all seem to be multiples of $3$.  In fact, we can justify that mathematically.  If we add $m$ $3$-litre buckets and $n$ $6$-litre buckets (where $m$ and $n$ are allowed to be negative — we can take water out of the pond), then we get $3m+6n=3(m+2n)$ litres in the pond, and that’s certainly a multiple of $3$.  The problem was that the highest common factor of the capacities was $3$, and that doesn’t divide our target amount (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens if I start with other buckets?  It might be that there’s a fairly obvious reason why we can’t make $1$ litre: if the highest common factor of the capacities of the two measuring buckets is bigger than $1$.  But if I give you two buckets where the highest common factor is $1$, will you necessarily be able to get $1$ litre from them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s translate what we’d like to do into mathematics.   We are given two positive whole numbers, $h$ and $k$, say.  Those are the capacities of the two buckets.  We are told that the highest common factor of $h$ and $k$ is $1$.  Then we’d like to know that there are integers $m$ and $n$ so that $hm+kn=1$.   The equation tells us to transfer $m$ $h$-buckets and $n$ $k$-buckets of water into the pond.  Of course, a negative number of buckets translates into removing water from the pond, so we may have to be careful about the order in which we do things (we need water in the pond before we can start removing water!).  \n",
    "\n",
    "I’ll let you convince yourself that if we can solve the equation (find $m$ and $n$) then it’s possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that the answer is that it is possible to solve the equation — that’s what Bezout‘s Theorem tells us.  Better still, we can give a constructive proof.  That is, the proof actually gives us a way to find a water-moving strategy that will give $1$ litre. So by repeating these steps we could get any (positive) whole number volume of water in the pond."

    "Before we get to the proof, let’s think about how we can find the highest common factor of two numbers. \n",
    "One way would be to find and compare the prime factorisations of the two numbers.  That’s fine, but finding prime factorisations can be extremely time-consuming if you’re dealing with large numbers.  Fortunately, there is another way using a tool called Euclid‘s algorithm.  Let’s see how it works by looking at an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say that we want to find the highest common factor of $121$ and $44$.  (OK, I know, that’s easy, because they’re small numbers.  So please temporarily forget that it’s easy, and bear with me.  It wouldn’t be as easy if I were using larger numbers!)  It seems to me to be quite natural to try to divide $121$ by $44$.  We get\n",

    "\n",

So any common factor of $121$ and $44$ is also a common factor of $44$ and $33$, and those are smaller numbers.  So let’s play the same game again: divide $44$ by $33$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$44 = 33 + 11.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s try the same thing again: we divide $33$ by $11$.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We’d like to use these three equations to show that the highest common factor of $121$ and $44$ is $11$.  Let’s do this in two stages.  First we’ll show that $11$ really is a common factor of $121$ and $44$, and then we’ll show that any common factor of $121$ and $44$ must divide $11$ — that is, $11$ is the highest common factor.  (Of course, this is all very easy with such small numbers, where we could just check directly, but let’s see how these equations do the work for us.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The third equation tells us that $11$ is a factor of $33$.  Then from the second equation we see that, since $11$ divides the right-hand side, $11$ must also divide the left-hand side, $44$.  Now $11$ divides $33$ and $44$, so $11$ divides the right-hand side of the first equation, so $11$ also divides the left-hand side, namely $121$.  We’ve argued that $11$ divides both $121$ and $44$ — it’s a common factor.  That’s the first stage done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s take any common factor $d$ of $121$ and $44$; we want to show that $d$ is a factor of $11$.  The first equation tells us that $d$ is a factor of $33$.  Then the second equation shows that $d$ is a factor of $11$.  And that’s exactly what we wanted.\n",

    "By working through the equations twice, once from last to first and once from first to second-last, we showed that the highest common factor of $121$ and $44$ is $11$.\n",
