Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers (or sad numbers).\n",

    "## Step $(1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "We recall that the remainder that when you divide by $9$ is unchanged when the number is replaced by its digit sum. So any number which has remainder 1 when divided by $9$, of the general form $9n+1$, for some integer $n$ will eventually reach $1$ and be happy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove this trick with the digit sum you need to observe that each power of $10$, $10^m$ has remainder $1$ when divided by $9$. Since multiplication is well defined on remainders (proof needed), $10^n \\cong 1^n \\cong 1$ when we take remainder dividing by $9$.\n",
